			<h1>Community </h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Epsom Girlsâ€™ Grammar takes pride in having a sense of community and this is encouraged and built through social events such as Athletics Day, Parade Day and swimming sports. This gives students a strong sense of belonging and a positive learning environment which is crucial for subjects where teamwork, problem solving and constructive feedback is required.  </p>
