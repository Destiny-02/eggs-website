			<h1>Compassion </h1>
			<hr>
			<p>To be compassionate is to be capable of feeling empathy and understanding towards others. This is shown in Epsom Girls’ Grammar School where there are annual events such as “Random Acts of Kindness Week” and “Embrace Week”. On a daily basis and in a classroom situation, compassion is shown where students are caring towards their friends, teachers and classmates such as through helping peers out if they are finding the course difficult.  </p>
